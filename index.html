        <p><em>Lead Agile Coach at <strong><a href="https://kununu.com">kununu</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>My main objective is to lead teams to new levels of high-productivity through an <strong>Agile</strong> mindset.

          When I got my <strong>Master of Software Engineering</strong>, in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) I became a true “Agent of Change” and it is with that spirit that I want to keep my focus on continuously improve the state of software
          engineering, creating a
          truly efficient and human-centered vision of software development.

          “Lead by example!” - I want to become a worthy Leader that sets the example for others, allowing teams to perform at their best, growing continuously and achieving high levels of delivery; and ... have lots of fun while doing it! </p>
